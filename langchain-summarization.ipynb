AI and its many use cases have become a topic of public discussion no longer relegated to tech experts. AI\u2014generative AI, in particular\u2014has tremendous potential to transform society as we know it for good, boost productivity and unlock trillions in economic value in the coming years.\nAI\u2019s value is not limited to advances in industry and consumer products alone. When\u00a0implemented in a responsible way\u2014where the technology is fully governed, privacy is protected and decision making is transparent and explainable\u2014AI has the power to usher in a new era of government services. Such services can empower citizens and help restore trust in public entities by improving workforce efficiency and reducing operational costs in the public sector. On the backend, AI likewise has the potential to supercharge digital modernization in by, for example, automating the migration of legacy software to more flexible cloud-based applications, or accelerating mainframe application modernization.\nDespite the many potential advantages, many government agencies are still grasping on how to implement AI and generative AI in particular In many cases, government agencies around the globe face a choice. They can either embrace AI and its advantages, tapping into the technology\u2019s potential to help improve the lives of the citizens they serve. Or they can stay on the sidelines and risk missing out on AI\u2019s ability to help agencies more effectively meet their objectives.\nGovernment agencies early to adopt solutions leveraging AI and automation offer concrete insights into the technology\u2019s public sector benefits\u2014whether modernizing the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax return processing or using automation to greatly improve the efficiency of the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s Global Health Supply Chain Program. Other successful AI deployments reach citizens directly, including a virtual assistants like the one created by the Ukranian Embassy in the Czech Republic to provides information to Ukrainian citizens. The new wave of AI, with foundational models provided by generative AI, could represent the new major opportunity to put AI to work for governments.\nThree main areas of focus\u00a0\nGetting there, however, requires government agencies to focus on the main areas where AI use cases can benefit their agencies, and its customers the most. In our view, there are three main areas.\nThe first is workforce transformation, or digital labor. At all levels of governments, from national entities to local governments, public employees must be ready for this new AI era. While that can mean hiring new talent like data scientists and software programmers, it should also mean providing existing workers with the training they need to manage AI-related projects. With this can come improved productivity, as technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) hold the promise of relieving the need for heavy text data reading and analysis. The goal is to free up time for public employees to engage in high value meetings, creative thinking and meaningful work.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second major focus must be citizen support. For AI to truly benefit society, the public sector needs to prioritize use cases that directly benefit citizens. There is potential for a variety of uses in the future\u2014whether it\u2019s providing information in real time, personalizing services based on a citizen\u2019s particular needs, or hastening processes that have a reputation for being slow. For example, anyone who has ever had to file paperwork, or file a claim knows the feeling all too well: Sitting in an office for hours, waiting while employees click through endless screens, hunting and pecking for information stored in different databases. What if AI\u2019s ability to access, organize and leverage data could create new possibilities for improving government offerings, even those already available online, by unlocking data across agencies to deliver information and services more intuitively and proactively?\nThird, AI is also becoming a crucial component of the public sector\u2019s digital transformation efforts. Governments are regularly held back from true transformation by legacy systems with tightly coupled workflow rules that require substantial effort and significant cost to modernize. For example, public sector agencies can make better use of data by migrating certain technology systems to the cloud and infuse it with AI. AI-powered tools hold the potential to help with pattern detection in large stores of data, and also be able to write computer programs. This could benefit cost optimization and also strengthen cybersecurity, as it can help detect threats quickly. This way, instead of seeking hard-to-find skills, agencies can reduce their skills gap and tap into evolving talent.\u00a0\nCommitment to responsible AI\u00a0\nLast but not least, in IBM\u2019s view, no discussion of responsible AI in the public sector is complete without emphasizing the importance of the ethical use of the technology throughout its lifecycle of design, development, use, and maintenance\u2014something in which IBM has promoted in the industry for years. Along with healthcare organizations and financial services entities, government and public sector entities must strive to be seen as the most trusted institutions. That means humans should continue to be at the heart of the services delivered by government while monitoring for responsible deployment by relying on the five fundamental properties for trustworthy AI: explainability, fairness, transparency, robustness and privacy.\n\nExplainability: An AI system\u2019s ability to provide a human-interpretable explanation for its predictions and insights to the public in a way that does not hide behind technical jargon.\nFairness: An AI system\u2019s ability to treat individuals or groups equitably, depending on the context in which the AI system is used, countering biases and addressing discrimination related to protected characteristics, such as gender, race, age, and veteran status.\nTransparency: An AI system\u2019s ability to include and share information on how it has been designed and developed and what data from which sources have fed the system.\nRobustness: An AI system\u2019s ability to effectively handle exceptional conditions, such as abnormalities in input to guarantee consistent outputs.\nPrivacy: An AI system\u2019s ability to prioritize and safeguard consumers\u2019 privacy and data rights and address existing regulations in the data collection, storage and access and disclosure.\n\nAs long as AI is implemented in a way that includes all the traits mentioned above, it can help both governments and citizens alike in new ways. Perhaps the biggest benefit to AI and foundational models is its range: It can extend to even the smallest of agencies. It can be used even in state and local governmental projects, such as using models to improve how employees and citizens search databases to find out more about policies or government-issued benefits. By staying informed, responsible, and well-equipped on AI, the public sector has the ability to help shape a brighter and better future for all.\u00a0\u00a0\nIBM is committed to unleashing the transformative potential of foundation models and generative AI to help address high-stakes challenges.

While federal agencies have fielded more than a thousand AI use cases, they aren't yet widely leveraging the content-creation powers of ChatGPT, Google's Bard and other large language models.Part of the reason could be a lack of direction. The White House announced in May that the Office of Management and Budget plans to unveil policy guidance on the use of AI in the federal government sometime this summer. As of this writing, agencies have the AI Bill of Rights framework and an AI Risk Management Framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\u201cThe reason we aren\u2019t looking at, \u2018Hey, are agencies meeting the requirements of that law or not, or that guidance?\u2019 is because there are no specific requirements. It\u2019s all aspirational,\u201d said Kevin Walsh, a director on the Government Accountability Office's Information Technology and Cybersecurity team.But AI will enter the federal government workstream sooner rather than later.\u00a0Right now, Microsoft is bundling AI capabilities in its Bing search engine and Edge browser. Microsoft also recently rolled out Azure Open AI Service to government customers, which allows users to tap existing large language models to develop AI-based applications and services. Google allows Workspace administrators to add Bard functionality to its productivity suite. And agencies are looking at how to use generative AI features both internally and in public-facing digital services.AI enters the chatLarge language models trained on\u00a0text about a government program have the potential to make chatbots more helpful, said Dave Guarino, formerly of civic tech nonprofit Code for America and the U.S. Labor Department and who\u2019s now an independent technology consultant.\u00a0The tech could help match questions to the most similar answers in vast sets of vetted question-and-answer pairs where current chatbots don\u2019t work well.\u201cHow many government agencies have very large FAQs on their website, right?\u201d Guarino said. \u201cYou can imagine these things being used not to actually generate new text in response to a person, but to take the question and say, \u2018Of these 500 question-and-answer pairs that we know exist, which looks most similar to that question?\u2019... What you\u2019re using the large language model for in this case is just figuring out which is most relevant for them.\u201dThe tech could also go even further. Generative AI offers the potential to go from reading a script to \u201cgenerating the script in real time\u201d to create \u201ca more natural back-and-forth flow,\u201d said Santiago Milian, customer experience principal at Booz Allen Hamilton.\nThere are no specific requirements [for AI in government]. It\u2019s all aspirational.\n\u2014 Kevin Walsh, GAO\nSome agencies are already tapping into the potential of AI. The Office of Personnel Management is using AI functionality in a pilot offering to direct retirees and annuitants to agency resources and answer very basic questions.\u00a0Crunching dataGenerative AI can help solve persistent data interoperability problems, quickly recognize common data elements and perform deduplication tasks that are outside the scope of previous technologies.Ad Hoc has already worked with one agency to use an API to connect to Google\u2019s BERT to go through mandatory grant reporting. Ad Hoc didn't name the agency because it hasn\u2019t received approval to talk publicly about the work.\u00a0BERT is an open-source large language model, as are generative AI tools like ChatGPT. But it is designed to \u201cderive meaning from large amounts of text,\u201d as opposed to \u201cgenerate new content,\u201d explained Mark Headd, a government technology expert at Ad Hoc.The tech helped go through unstructured data to de-dupe 30% of database entries, something that \u201csimple methods \u2026 like exact string matching\u201d weren't able to do, an Ad Hoc blog post says.Straight talkGenerative AI could help the government rewrite jargon in a more understandable way.\u00a0\u201cThere just have never been enough resources, just not enough hours in the day, not enough people to do that kind of work,\u201d said Beth Simone Noveck, director of the Burnes Center for Social Change and GovLab at Northeastern University, chief innovation officer for New Jersey and former deputy chief technology officer in the Obama White House. \u201cIt's radically game-changing.\u201dOPM's top tech official recently told an audience at a technology conference that in the future the agency could leverage generative AI tools to help rewrite out-of-date job descriptions.In the benefits space, the back-and-forth format of generative AI could help staffers find what they need in long sets of guidance, policies and rules, and even go through the logic of how to apply complicated rules, Guarino said.Risks and opportunitiesSuresh Venkatasubramanian, a computer science and data science professor at Brown University, co-authored the White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights while on the staff of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\u00a0One risk: accuracy. These tools have been known to generate \u201challucinations\u201d not based in facts. Venkatasubramanian told Nextgov/FCW that generative AI apps have \"no notion of correctness\" and are \"essentially predictive models to predict \u2026 text they've been trained with.\u201dThe government will have to contend with questions about how vendors build their systems, what happens to data entered into systems and more, he said.Steve Bennett, global government practice lead at SAS, notes that another risk is that employees may blindly embrace the promise of generative AI without understanding its pitfalls. \u201cYou do not want government employees who don\u2019t understand the technology enough to be able to say, \u2018I don\u2019t believe that result,\u201d he said.\u00a0Even so, Northeastern\u2019s Noveck offered another framing for the risks: the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of not reaping the potential benefits of generative AI.\u201cHow do we actually more proactively embrace the opportunities, not just fret about the risks,\u201d she asked. \u201cWe're at a point in time in which rates of trust in government are at an all-time low. Worse yet, rates of trust in democracy are declining. We cannot afford to let those rates slip lower by having government be any less effective than it can be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare This:\n\n\n\nNEXT STORY:\n\n              The Investigations Room - Breaking Through Dead Ends\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Management\n      \n    \nReinventing government: Reflections 30 years later\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Workforce\n      \n    \nRetiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Management\n      \n    \n'Long, Long Overdue': An Oral History of the GPRA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Workforce\n      \n    \nState of the Unions: A New Normal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Oversight\n      \n    \nWhat I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        sponsor content\n      \n    \nBuild government trust with better service to constituents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Management\n      \n    \nReinventing government: Reflections 30 years later\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Workforce\n      \n    \nRetiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Management\n      \n    \n'Long, Long Overdue': An Oral History of the GPRA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Workforce\n      \n    \nState of the Unions: A New Normal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        Oversight\n      \n    \nWhat I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        sponsor content\n      \n    \nBuild government trust with better service to constituents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\nThis website uses cookies to enhance user experience and to analyze performance and\n      traffic on our website.

AI and its many use cases have become a topic of public discussion no longer relegated to tech experts. AI\u2014generative AI, in particular\u2014has tremendous potential to transform society as we know it for good, boost productivity and unlock trillions in economic value in the coming years.\\nAI\u2019s value is not limited to advances in industry and consumer products alone. When\\xa0implemented in a responsible way\u2014where the technology is fully governed, privacy is protected and decision making is transparent and explainable\u2014AI has the power to usher in a new era of government services. Such services can empower citizens and help restore trust in public entities by improving workforce efficiency and reducing operational costs in the public sector. On the backend, AI likewise has the potential to supercharge digital modernization in by, for example, automating the migration of legacy software to more flexible cloud-based applications, or accelerating mainframe application modernization.\\nDespite the many potential advantages, many government agencies are still grasping on how to implement AI and generative AI in particular In many cases, government agencies around the globe face a choice. They can either embrace AI and its advantages, tapping into the technology\u2019s potential to help improve the lives of the citizens they serve. Or they can stay on the sidelines and risk missing out on AI\u2019s ability to help agencies more effectively meet their objectives.\\nGovernment agencies early to adopt solutions leveraging AI and automation offer concrete insights into the technology\u2019s public sector benefits\u2014whether modernizing the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax return processing or using automation to greatly improve the efficiency of the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s Global Health Supply Chain Program. Other successful AI deployments reach citizens directly, including a virtual assistants like the one created by the Ukranian Embassy in the Czech Republic to provides information to Ukrainian citizens. The new wave of AI, with foundational models provided by generative AI, could represent the new major opportunity to put AI to work for governments.\\nThree main areas of focus\\xa0\\nGetting there, however, requires government agencies to focus on the main areas where AI use cases can benefit their agencies, and its customers the most. In our view, there are three main areas.\\nThe first is workforce transformation, or digital labor. At all levels of governments, from national entities to local governments, public employees must be ready for this new AI era. While that can mean hiring new talent like data scientists and software programmers, it should also mean providing existing workers with the training they need to manage AI-related projects. With this can come improved productivity, as technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) hold the promise of relieving the need for heavy text data reading and analysis. The goal is to free up time for public employees to engage in high value meetings, creative thinking and meaningful work.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe second major focus must be citizen support. For AI to truly benefit society, the public sector needs to prioritize use cases that directly benefit citizens. There is potential for a variety of uses in the future\u2014whether it\u2019s providing information in real time, personalizing services based on a citizen\u2019s particular needs, or hastening processes that have a reputation for being slow. For example, anyone who has ever had to file paperwork, or file a claim knows the feeling all too well: Sitting in an office for hours, waiting while employees click through endless screens, hunting and pecking for information stored in different databases. What if AI\u2019s ability to access, organize and leverage data could create new possibilities for improving government offerings, even those already available online, by unlocking data across agencies to deliver information and services more intuitively and proactively?\\nThird, AI is also becoming a crucial component of the public sector\u2019s digital transformation efforts. Governments are regularly held back from true transformation by legacy systems with tightly coupled workflow rules that require substantial effort and significant cost to modernize. For example, public sector agencies can make better use of data by migrating certain technology systems to the cloud and infuse it with AI. AI-powered tools hold the potential to help with pattern detection in large stores of data, and also be able to write computer programs. This could benefit cost optimization and also strengthen cybersecurity, as it can help detect threats quickly. This way, instead of seeking hard-to-find skills, agencies can reduce their skills gap and tap into evolving talent.\\xa0\\nCommitment to responsible AI\\xa0\\nLast but not least, in IBM\u2019s view, no discussion of responsible AI in the public sector is complete without emphasizing the importance of the ethical use of the technology throughout its lifecycle of design, development, use, and maintenance\u2014something in which IBM has promoted in the industry for years. Along with healthcare organizations and financial services entities, government and public sector entities must strive to be seen as the most trusted institutions. That means humans should continue to be at the heart of the services delivered by government while monitoring for responsible deployment by relying on the five fundamental properties for trustworthy AI: explainability, fairness, transparency, robustness and privacy.\\n\\nExplainability: An AI system\u2019s ability to provide a human-interpretable explanation for its predictions and insights to the public in a way that does not hide behind technical jargon.\\nFairness: An AI system\u2019s ability to treat individuals or groups equitably, depending on the context in which the AI system is used, countering biases and addressing discrimination related to protected characteristics, such as gender, race, age, and veteran status.\\nTransparency: An AI system\u2019s ability to include and share information on how it has been designed and developed and what data from which sources have fed the system.\\nRobustness: An AI system\u2019s ability to effectively handle exceptional conditions, such as abnormalities in input to guarantee consistent outputs.\\nPrivacy: An AI system\u2019s ability to prioritize and safeguard consumers\u2019 privacy and data rights and address existing regulations in the data collection, storage and access and disclosure.\\n\\nAs long as AI is implemented in a way that includes all the traits mentioned above, it can help both governments and citizens alike in new ways. Perhaps the biggest benefit to AI and foundational models is its range: It can extend to even the smallest of agencies. It can be used even in state and local governmental projects, such as using models to improve how employees and citizens search databases to find out more about policies or government-issued benefits. By staying informed, responsible, and well-equipped on AI, the public sector has the ability to help shape a brighter and better future for all.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIBM is committed to unleashing the transformative potential of foundation models and generative AI to help address high-stakes challenges. We provide open and targeted value creating AI solutions for businesses and public sector institutions.

While federal agencies have fielded more than a thousand AI use cases, they aren\\'t yet widely leveraging the content-creation powers of ChatGPT, Google\\'s Bard and other large language models.Part of the reason could be a lack of direction. The White House announced in May that the Office of Management and Budget plans to unveil policy guidance on the use of AI in the federal government sometime this summer. As of this writing, agencies have the AI Bill of Rights framework and an AI Risk Management Framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\u201cThe reason we aren\u2019t looking at, \u2018Hey, are agencies meeting the requirements of that law or not, or that guidance?\u2019 is because there are no specific requirements. It\u2019s all aspirational,\u201d said Kevin Walsh, a director on the Government Accountability Office\\'s Information Technology and Cybersecurity team.But AI will enter the federal government workstream sooner rather than later.\\xa0Right now, Microsoft is bundling AI capabilities in its Bing search engine and Edge browser. Microsoft also recently rolled out Azure Open AI Service to government customers, which allows users to tap existing large language models to develop AI-based applications and services. Google allows Workspace administrators to add Bard functionality to its productivity suite. And agencies are looking at how to use generative AI features both internally and in public-facing digital services.AI enters the chatLarge language models trained on\\xa0text about a government program have the potential to make chatbots more helpful, said Dave Guarino, formerly of civic tech nonprofit Code for America and the U.S. Labor Department and who\u2019s now an independent technology consultant.\\xa0The tech could help match questions to the most similar answers in vast sets of vetted question-and-answer pairs where current chatbots don\u2019t work well.\u201cHow many government agencies have very large FAQs on their website, right?\u201d Guarino said. \u201cYou can imagine these things being used not to actually generate new text in response to a person, but to take the question and say, \u2018Of these 500 question-and-answer pairs that we know exist, which looks most similar to that question?\u2019... What you\u2019re using the large language model for in this case is just figuring out which is most relevant for them.\u201dThe tech could also go even further. Generative AI offers the potential to go from reading a script to \u201cgenerating the script in real time\u201d to create \u201ca more natural back-and-forth flow,\u201d said Santiago Milian, customer experience principal at Booz Allen Hamilton.\\nThere are no specific requirements [for AI in government]. It\u2019s all aspirational.\\n\u2014 Kevin Walsh, GAO\\nSome agencies are already tapping into the potential of AI. The Office of Personnel Management is using AI functionality in a pilot offering to direct retirees and annuitants to agency resources and answer very basic questions.\\xa0Crunching dataGenerative AI can help solve persistent data interoperability problems, quickly recognize common data elements and perform deduplication tasks that are outside the scope of previous technologies.Ad Hoc has already worked with one agency to use an API to connect to Google\u2019s BERT to go through mandatory grant reporting. Ad Hoc didn\\'t name the agency because it hasn\u2019t received approval to talk publicly about the work.\\xa0BERT is an open-source large language model, as are generative AI tools like ChatGPT. But it is designed to \u201cderive meaning from large amounts of text,\u201d as opposed to \u201cgenerate new content,\u201d explained Mark Headd, a government technology expert at Ad Hoc.The tech helped go through unstructured data to de-dupe 30% of database entries, something that \u201csimple methods \u2026 like exact string matching\u201d weren\\'t able to do, an Ad Hoc blog post says.Straight talkGenerative AI could help the government rewrite jargon in a more understandable way.\\xa0\u201cThere just have never been enough resources, just not enough hours in the day, not enough people to do that kind of work,\u201d said Beth Simone Noveck, director of the Burnes Center for Social Change and GovLab at Northeastern University, chief innovation officer for New Jersey and former deputy chief technology officer in the Obama White House. \u201cIt\\'s radically game-changing.\u201dOPM\\'s top tech official recently told an audience at a technology conference that in the future the agency could leverage generative AI tools to help rewrite out-of-date job descriptions.In the benefits space, the back-and-forth format of generative AI could help staffers find what they need in long sets of guidance, policies and rules, and even go through the logic of how to apply complicated rules, Guarino said.Risks and opportunitiesSuresh Venkatasubramanian, a computer science and data science professor at Brown University, co-authored the White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights while on the staff of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\\xa0One risk: accuracy. These tools have been known to generate \u201challucinations\u201d not based in facts. Venkatasubramanian told Nextgov/FCW that generative AI apps have \"no notion of correctness\" and are \"essentially predictive models to predict \u2026 text they\\'ve been trained with.\u201dThe government will have to contend with questions about how vendors build their systems, what happens to data entered into systems and more, he said.Steve Bennett, global government practice lead at SAS, notes that another risk is that employees may blindly embrace the promise of generative AI without understanding its pitfalls. \u201cYou do not want government employees who don\u2019t understand the technology enough to be able to say, \u2018I don\u2019t believe that result,\u201d he said.\\xa0Even so, Northeastern\u2019s Noveck offered another framing for the risks: the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of not reaping the potential benefits of generative AI.\u201cHow do we actually more proactively embrace the opportunities, not just fret about the risks,\u201d she asked. \u201cWe\\'re at a point in time in which rates of trust in government are at an all-time low. Worse yet, rates of trust in democracy are declining. We cannot afford to let those rates slip lower by having government be any less effective than it can be.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare This:\\n\\n\\n\\nNEXT STORY:\\n\\n              The Investigations Room - Breaking Through Dead Ends\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Management\\n      \\n    \\nReinventing government: Reflections 30 years later\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Workforce\\n      \\n    \\nRetiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Management\\n      \\n    \\n\\'Long, Long Overdue\\': An Oral History of the GPRA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Workforce\\n      \\n    \\nState of the Unions: A New Normal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Oversight\\n      \\n    \\nWhat I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        sponsor content\\n      \\n    \\nBuild government trust with better service to constituents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Management\\n      \\n    \\nReinventing government: Reflections 30 years later\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Workforce\\n      \\n    \\nRetiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Management\\n      \\n    \\n\\'Long, Long Overdue\\': An Oral History of the GPRA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Workforce\\n      \\n    \\nState of the Unions: A New Normal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        Oversight\\n      \\n    \\nWhat I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n        sponsor content\\n      \\n    \\nBuild government trust with better service to constituents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\nThis website uses cookies to enhance user experience and to analyze performance and\\n      traffic on our website.

What can AI and generative AI do for governments? Government September 20, 2023 By Florian Breger Cristina Caballe Fuguet 4 min read Few technologies have taken the world by storm the way artificial intelligence (AI) has over the past few years. AI and its many use cases have become a topic of public discussion no longer relegated to tech experts. AI\u2014generative AI, in particular\u2014has tremendous potential to transform society as we know it for good, boost productivity and unlock trillions in economic value in the coming years. AI\u2019s value is not limited to advances in industry and consumer products alone. When implemented in a responsible way\u2014where the technology is fully governed, privacy is protected and decision making is transparent and explainable\u2014AI has the power to usher in a new era of government services. Such services can empower citizens and help restore trust in public entities by improving workforce efficiency and reducing operational costs in the public sector. On the backend, AI likewise\n\n2.

You might want to play around with trying different documents, tweaking the model runtime parameters, and trying a different model alltogether to see how things behave. One of the most important things to note in order to get good results is that the way the input is chunked and tokenized matters a lot. Passing poor map results will result in a lower quality summarization."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.10", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.10.13", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
