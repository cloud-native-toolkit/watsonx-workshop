# Lab 5: LangChain and IBM's Watson Machine Learning Python Library

### Introduction
[LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) is a popular framework for developing applications powered by LLMs. The LangChain team's goal is to make connecting multiple calls between LLMs easier to code while adding functionality for templates, input/output parsing, history management, agents and integrating the models with external APIs.  If you know of LangChain competitors to recommend, please let the Boot Camp leads know.

### Get Started
Launch the ["Using LangChain with IBM WatsonX" notebook](./watsonxai-and-langchain.ipynb) to learn more.
