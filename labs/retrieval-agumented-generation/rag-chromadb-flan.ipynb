    "### About Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a versatile pattern that can unlock a number of use cases requiring factual recall of information, such as querying a knowledge base in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, RAG requires these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract knowledge base passages from documents (once)\n",
    "2. Create vector embedding representations of each passage in the knowledge base\n",
    "3. Retreive question from end user and generate vector embedding for it.\n",
    "4. Retrieve relevant passage(s) from knowledge base (for every user query) using vector similarity search\n",
    "5. Generate a response by feeding retrieved passage into a large language model (for every user query)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work through each of these steps in the following notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/rag-architecture-basic.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings and Vector Databases\n",
    "The current state-of-the-art in RAG is to create dense vector representations of the knowledge base in order to calculate the semantic similarity to a given user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate dense vector representations using embedding models. In this notebook, we use [SentenceTransformers](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=sentencetransformers&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to embed both the knowledge base passages and user queries. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is a performant open-source model that is small enough to run locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector database is optimized for dense vector indexing and retrieval. This notebook uses [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com), a user-friendly open-source vector database, licensed under Apache 2.0, which offers good speed and performance with the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the final response to a query based on the retrieved passage, we leverage an open-source model, [Flan-UL2 (20B)](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-ul2), and include a prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the example dataset\n",
    "The dataset used in this cookbook is a subset of [nq_open](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nq_open), an open-source question answering dataset based on contents from Wikipedia. The selected subset includes the gold standard passages to answer the queries in the dataset, which enables evaluating the retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can select one of the two dataset available:\n",
    "1. **nq910** - an information retrieval (a.k.a. search) data set extracted from Google's Natural Questions dataset.\n",
    "2. **LongNQ** - an end-to-end retrieval and answer dataset extracted from the same NQ dataset, but focused more on abstractive, longer-form question answering. The answers were modified for fluency by IBM Research.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets are available in the [data](data) folder."

The first tickets were purchased on October 3 , 1985 . The California State Lottery Act of 1984 was intended to provide more money to schools without imposing extra taxes . Accordingly , the Lottery was required to provide at least 34 % of its revenues to public education , supplementing ( not replacing ) other funds provided by California . Another 50 % of its revenues must be paid to the public in the form of prizes , making a mandated minimum of 84 % of all funds that must be given back to the public in the form of prizes or funds for public education . The remainder , a maximum of 16 % , was to be spent on administration , such as salaries and running the games .

To compute this metric, for every answer returned for a question, we measure the maximum subsequence of words between the system answer and the gold-standard answer. Given this sequence, we can compute the precision of the given answer as the length (all lengths are in words) of this sequence divided by the length of the system answer and the recall as the length of the longest common subsequence divided by the length the gold-standard answer.\n",
