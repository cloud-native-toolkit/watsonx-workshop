**Freeform mode**
For a plain text editing mode, click Freeform. When you click Generate in freeform mode, the prompt text is sent to the model exactly as you typed it.

**Structured mode**
To enter different parts of your prompt in separate text areas, click Structured.

Instruction: In the Set Up section, you can specify an instruction, if it makes sense for your use case. An instruction is an imperative statement, such as "Summarize the following article."
Examples: Also in the Set Up section, you can specify one or more pairs of example input and the corresponding desired output. If you need a specific prefix to the input or the output, you can replace the default labels, "Input:" or "Output:", with your desired labels. (Providing a few example input-output pairs in your prompt is called few-shot prompting.)
Test input: In the Try section, you can enter the final input of your prompt.
When you click Generate in structured mode, the text from the fields is sent to the model in a template format.
