# Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
If you already have VS Code installed, then proceed to [configure your environment in VS Code](#configure-python-environment). Otherwise proceed to [download and install Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  Be careful to select the correct installation based on your current CPU type.

Once your installation is complete proceed to [configure your environment in VS Code](#configure-python-environment).

### Configure Your Python Environment in VS Code <a id="configure-python-environment"></a>
For VS Code to find the python libraries installed on your computer, you will need to show it the location of your Python environment.  The VS Code team provides an excellent walkthrough of creating and selecting environments in VS Code.  As you've already created your environment in your console/terminal window earlier, you can skip that section and scroll down to the section called "Select and Activate an Environment".

Proceed to [Select and Activate an Environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment).
